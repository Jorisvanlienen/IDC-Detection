Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent type of breast cancers. The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer specimens. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive).

By training a convolutional neural network I aimed to make a recognition model for whether a photo contains aggressive tumors or not. The accuracy of the model appeared to be slightly poor: 84.90%. With a true positive rate of 85.03% and true negative of 84.70%.

Human tissue classification is a particularly challenging task. Issues with slide preparation, variations in staining (coloration of substances to facilitate examinations) and  biological variance, such as the presentation of different grades of disease, make image datasets of medical specimens difficult to work with.
